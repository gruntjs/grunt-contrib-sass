[Sass](http://sass-lang.com) is a preprocessor that adds nested rules, variables, mixins and functions, selector inheritance, and more to CSS. Sass files compile into well-formatted, standard CSS to use in your site or application.

This task requires you to have the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk) and [Dart Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) installed and for Dart Sass to be added into your system's `PATH`. Refer to the links for an installation guide on each dependency. To confirm that you've installed the right Dart SDK version, run `dart --version` and make sure that the version is `>=2.0.0`. Then, to confirm you've install Dart Sass, run `sass --version` and make sure it only displays a version number `>= 1.5.0` **without** a version name. (If you are using any other version of Sass other than Dart Sass, then a version name will proceed the version number, e.g. `Ruby Sass x.x.x`.)

Note: Files that begin with "_" are ignored even if they match the globbing pattern. This is done to match the expected [Sass partial behaviour](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials).

> [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) was deprecated in March 2018. It's recommended that you migrate to [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), but for anyone still using Ruby Sass, use `npm install grunt-contrib-sass@1.0.0 --save-dev` and refer back to the [README](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass/blob/4d564555ecb138108129c53a896bf03818d11e3d/README.md) v1.0.0 instead.
